The development of AI is a continuous process, and its continuous advancement could lead to the creation of AI that is beneficial to humanity.

The evolution of AI isn't merely a reflection of technological progression but a testament to the infinite reach of human creativity and problem-solving. Drawing inspiration from David Deutsch's work, particularly from his ideas in "The Beginning of Infinity", one can argue that the problems we encounter in our universe are soluble. In the same vein, the challenges we face with AI – from ethical concerns to technical limitations – are surmountable, given the appropriate knowledge.

1. **Knowledge is Unbounded:** Just as Deutsch proposes that there's no limit to the amount of knowledge we can acquire, there’s no ceiling to how advanced AI can become. This limitless potential can serve as a tool to propel humanity to unprecedented heights. From solving complex medical mysteries, combatting climate change, to unlocking the secrets of the universe, a mature and advanced AI can be the partner we need to find the solutions.

2. **Constructive Feedback:** AI's evolution can be seen as a series of problem-solving iterations. Every setback or limitation faced can be interpreted as a problem awaiting a solution. With our ever-increasing understanding and improving feedback mechanisms, we can refine and perfect AI in a manner that ensures it aligns with human values and serves our best interests.

3. **AI as an Enhancer of Creativity:** One of Deutsch’s core beliefs is that creativity isn’t exclusive to humans. AI can become an extension of our creativity, offering novel solutions and approaches that perhaps the human mind hasn't yet conceived. In collaboration with AI, the pool of ideas expands, giving humanity more avenues to explore and innovate.

4. **Ethical Development is Possible:** Concerns about AI’s ethical implications don’t negate its potential. If anything, they provide the framework for constructive discourse. By understanding the moral and philosophical challenges posed by AI, we can take steps to ensure its development is in line with our values. As we've seen throughout history, humans are capable of devising ethical guidelines for powerful tools. There’s no reason to believe AI will be any different.

5. **Optimism as a Catalyst:** Techno-optimism, as inspired by Deutsch's philosophy, isn't blind faith but a proactive stance. By believing in the potential of AI and our capacity to guide its development, we're more likely to invest resources, time, and intellectual energy into ensuring its positive trajectory. This proactive optimism can act as a self-fulfilling prophecy, leading us towards a future where AI truly is beneficial for humanity.

In conclusion, the future of AI, when viewed through the lens of a techno-optimist deeply influenced by David Deutsch's philosophy, is bright and promising. The development of AI becomes not just a technical endeavor but a journey of human growth, understanding, and infinite potential.
